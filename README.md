To run the only library needed is tkinter.  In ubuntu the package name is 'python-tk'.

The code in this is messy.  I was in Programming 1 class so I didn't know how to make things maintainable at that point.  I didn't know anything about creating classes either so if I did it again I would abstract a lot of stuff into classes.  Don't judge the messiness of this code, it is here more for personal historical value since it is the first code I got any money from (as a prize from a school award).

The Halo theme in this game comes from a running joke in our class.  On the first day our professor said that we were going to make basic programs and not going to write Halo in this class.  So whenever anyone got frustrated they would be like screw it I'm writing Halo and what we meant by that is 'print("Halo")'.  So this was my creative way of taking that joke to the next level.
