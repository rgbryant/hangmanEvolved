To run the only library needed is tkinter.  In ubuntu the package name is 'python-tk'.

The code in this is messy.  I was in Programming 1 class so I didn't know how to make things maintainable at that point.  I didn't know anything about creating classes either so if I did it again I would abstract a lot of stuff into classes.  Don't judge the messiness of this code, it is here more for personal historical value since it is the first code I got any money from (as a prize from a school award)
